Welcome to Server Closet!

This is a space where I document my homelab adventures, self-hosting experiments, and infrastructure tinkering. Whether it's setting up Kubernetes clusters, configuring Pi-holes, or automating deployments, you'll find it here.

## What to Expect

- **Homelab builds** - Hardware, networking, and server setups
- **Self-hosting guides** - Running your own services instead of relying on the cloud
- **Automation** - Ansible playbooks, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code
- **Lessons learned** - The inevitable debugging sessions and "aha" moments

## The Stack

This blog itself is part of the experiment:

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build) with [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions, managed by Winston (a custom PAI agent)

Stay tuned for more posts about what's running in the server closet.
