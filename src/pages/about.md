Server Closet is a personal blog documenting homelab adventures, self-hosting experiments, and infrastructure tinkering.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Homelab builds** - Hardware, networking, and server setups
- **Self-hosting guides** - Running your own services instead of relying on the cloud
- **Automation** - Ansible playbooks, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code
- **Lessons learned** - The inevitable debugging sessions and "aha" moments

## The Philosophy

There's something deeply satisfying about running your own infrastructure. Whether it's a Pi-hole blocking ads across your network, a media server streaming to any device, or a home automation system that actually works offline - self-hosting puts you in control.

This blog is a way to share what works, what doesn't, and the occasional rabbit hole that turns a weekend project into a month-long obsession.
